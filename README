Resolve files in VCS.

No need to install. If you want, put `vcs-resolve.py` in your $PATH or symlink it from somewhere.
Needs Python3.

Run as:

    $> vcs-resolve <something or nothing>

To use with Emacs, load `vcs-resolve.el`. Something like:

    (use-package vcs-resolve
     :commands (vcs-resolve-buffer
                vcs-resolve-region)
     :load-path "/home/lbolla/src/vcs-resolve/")
